# Helping Paws
Adopting dogs can be a life-changing experience. With such a large number of dogs entering shelters every year, existing dog adoption systems could take anywhere from a day to a month to match dogs with their new owners. As with any adoption service, staff members typically have to perform extensive interview processes and background checks on potential adopters. By fully digitizing the adoption system, organizations can easily profile both future pet parents and the dogs they currently home. Helping Paws pet adoption system aims to expedite this process to maximize efficiency while ensuring that dogs are assigned proper homes matching and even exceeding current adoption standards.
